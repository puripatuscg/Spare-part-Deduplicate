index0 (1)
reason:
Both records describe the same SKF cylindrical roller bearing NU 1015. They share the identical bearing type and model number, and the query’s “ML” suffix (machined brass cage) is technically equivalent to the candidate’s specification of a brass cage (“NU 1015 m”). The standard ISO dimensions 75×115×20 mm also match exactly, confirming they represent the same physical material.

index2 (3) (2answer)

reason:
All matched records represent the same deep groove ball bearing with ISO part number 6012-2Z. They share identical core technical specifications, including bearing type, size, normal internal clearance, cylindrical bore, and double metal shields (2Z). The differences between records are limited to descriptive text or application notes, which do not affect the physical identity of the material. Therefore, these records are grouped as the same material.

index9 (10)

reason:
Both records describe the same narrow V-belt with RMA specification 5V 1600. They share the identical belt section (5V) and length (1600), which uniquely define the physical product. Any differences between records are limited to system or plant registration details and do not affect the material identity.
